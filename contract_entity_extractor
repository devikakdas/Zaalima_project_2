 Intelligent Document Processing (NLP)
    Project Title: Legal Contract Entity Extractor (NER)
    Product Brand Name: "LexiScan Auto"

We're building a production-grade NLP (Natural Language Processing) system that:
    1.Uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from PDFs
    2.Applies a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model fine-tuned on legal documents
    3.Implements rule-based validation to ensure accuracy
    4.Exposes a REST API for integration with other systems
    5.Includes MLOps infrastructure (monitoring, versioning, automated retraining)

Real-World Impact:
Before: 10 minutes per contract, error rate ~5%
After: 5 seconds per contract, error rate <1%
Scalability: Process 1000+ contracts per hour
Cost Savings: Reduce manual labor by 90%
